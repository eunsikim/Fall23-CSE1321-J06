/*
 * In this simple program, we are going to simulate a car.
 * We will only define 2 attributes, the engine status (ON/OFF)
 * and the percentage of gas in the tank.
 * 
 * To simluate the car, we implement a while loop that should 
 * decrease the tank by 5% per each iteration.
 * 
 * Moreover, the loop should only run if the engine is on and the tank
 * is either empty or has some gas left.
